## Ingredients

4 eggs (separate the yolks from the whites)  
75 gr sugar (1)  
75 gr sugar (2)  
100 gr flour  
vanilla sugar or vanilla extract  
 

## Preparation

Line a 20cm mould.

Preheat the oven to 180C. Sift the flour.
Whip the whites to stiff peaks with the sugar (1). Start beating the whites at a low speed, gradually increasing it after each addition of sugar.
Beat the yolks with the sugar (2) until light and fluffy, the sugar should dissolve as much as possible.
Add a third of the beaten whites to the beaten yolks and mix gently, making sure to keep the whites as airy as possible.
Add the sifted flour and mix with the egg and sugar mixture until smooth. Then add all the whites and mix them in again as gently as possible, being careful to keep the volume of the whites!
Cover the bottom of the mould, do not grease the sides! Spread the dough and flatten it out. Bake in a preheated oven for 30-35 minutes. When you take the biscuit out of the oven, immediately turn it over and leave it to cool for 10-15 minutes. Then take the biscuit out of the mould and leave it for another 8-10 hours.
